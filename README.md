# Neonatal Monitoring

## üß† Introduction

The **neonatal period**‚Äîthe first 28 days of life‚Äîis the most vulnerable time for a child‚Äôs survival. In 2016 alone, 2.6 million neonatal deaths accounted for 46% of all under-five child deaths globally. Neonates are highly susceptible to infections and diseases such as **Down syndrome**, **Cystic Fibrosis**, and **Blood Cell Disorders**, due to their underdeveloped immune systems.

Technological advancements in continuous monitoring and early diagnosis have played a critical role in reducing infant mortality. Among these, **heart rate variability (HRV)** has emerged as an important biomarker in predicting conditions like **neonatal sepsis**.

This project leverages **sensor-based real-time data collection**, **machine learning**, and **cloud communication** to monitor neonatal vitals and predict possible health complications.

## üè• Project Overview

The system captures **live heart rate and temperature** data using embedded sensors and transmits it via a **GSM module** to a web-based interface. Using a trained **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm, the system detects abnormalities and sends alerts through **SMS notifications** and an **on-device buzzer**.

## üîÑ System Architecture

1. **Sensor Readings**: Heart rate and temperature values are captured using DHT11 and a heartbeat sensor.
2. **Transmission**: Data is sent via GSM SIM900 to a cloud server.
3. **Prediction**:
   - A **KNN model** (pre-trained on 1000 labeled records) receives live data.
   - Preprocessing ensures the incoming data is clean and formatted correctly.
   - Real-time predictions are made on incoming data to detect abnormal vitals.
4. **Alerts**:
   - If critical conditions are detected, the system:
     - Triggers an audio alert (buzzer)
     - Sends an SMS to the associated healthcare provider
5. **Web Application**:
   - Displays real-time vitals
   - Shows prediction results
   - Allows manual data upload for batch analysis

## üåê Web Application Features

- **Login Page**: Secure access to system
- **Live Values Page**: Real-time monitoring of vitals fetched from GSM
- **Results Page**: View predictions made by KNN on current data
- **Data Upload Page**: Upload historical data for analysis

Each live data point is processed through the KNN model. Prediction results are displayed, and alerts are generated in real time.
